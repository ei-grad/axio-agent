    Every field is read by its declared name and type, so a misspelled key is a type error at the
    place that uses it rather than a default quietly standing in for the value. A field the
    provider did not send, sent as null, or sent as the wrong type takes its default. That is what
    an optional provider field is, and one bad field must not lose the whole event.

    A nested object is another ``Wire``; a list of them is ``list[ThatWire]``. Give a shape no
    ``name=`` and it is only ever nested, never dispatched to.

    Declare a field ``raw: Payload`` and it receives the whole payload, for a shape that varies too
    much to declare whole. A citation arrives under five shapes and each names its span
    differently, so the fields worth reading are declared and the rest travels beside them.

    Declaring a shape registers it nowhere. A ``Reader`` claims it with ``@on(ThatShape)``.
