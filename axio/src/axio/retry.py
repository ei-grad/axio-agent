"""When an HTTP attempt is worth repeating, and how long to wait before repeating it.

One rule for every transport. Written out per transport they drifted apart: one retried only 429,
500 and 503, so the 502 and 504 a proxy returns in front of a slow streaming endpoint failed the
turn there while the same failure was retried everywhere else. The same transport ignored
``Retry-After``, which is how a rate-limited provider says when to come back.

This module imports no HTTP client. ``retry_delay`` takes anything with a ``headers`` mapping.
