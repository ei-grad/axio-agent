# Core Concepts

Axio is assembled from a small set of well-defined building blocks. Each one
has a single responsibility and a stable interface. Swap any of them without
touching the rest.

## Building blocks

### Agent

The {doc}`Agent <agent>` is the central orchestrator. It is a `slots=True`
dataclass that wires a transport, a context store, and a set of tools into a
loop:

1. Send conversation history to the transport.
2. Collect `StreamEvent` values as they arrive, forwarding every one of them to
   the consumer and folding text, refusals and reasoning into the turn.
3. When the model issues tool calls - dispatch all of them **concurrently** via
   `asyncio.gather`, append the results, and loop.
4. Otherwise store the turn and let the stop reason decide. `end_turn` and
   `refusal` end the run, `pause_turn` resumes it, and anything else ends it
   with an `Error`.

Derive a configured agent with `agent.copy(**overrides)` rather than mutating
one.

The agent is deliberately thin. It has no opinions about retries, rate limits,
or logging. Those belong to the transport or the application layer.

### Transport

A {doc}`transport <protocols>` is any object that implements the
`CompletionTransport` protocol - a single `stream()` method that takes the
conversation history and yields `StreamEvent` values. The core package ships no
transport of its own. Install the one that matches your model provider:

| Package | Provider |
|---|---|
| `axio-transport-anthropic` | Anthropic Claude |
| `axio-transport-openai` | OpenAI Responses and OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions APIs |
| `axio-transport-codex` | ChatGPT via OAuth |
| `axio-transport-google` | Google Gemini (Developer API and Vertex AI) |

Because a transport is just a protocol, you can implement your own with nothing
more than `aiohttp`. No SDK is required. The shipped transports read their
`text/event-stream` responses through `axio-sse` rather than parsing SSE by
hand. See {doc}`../guides/writing-transports`.

### Tools

A plain `async def` function is a tool handler. The {doc}`Tool <tools>`
dataclass is the glue that declares it as an agent tool. It attaches a stable
name, generated input schema, description, guards, and an optional concurrency
limit. A tool call is one concrete model request to invoke that definition.

The `context` field on `Tool` lets you pass arbitrary state - a database
connection, a sandbox object, a file path - to the handler via `CONTEXT.get()`
at call time without any global state or class-level variables.

### Field Metadata

The {doc}`field metadata <field>` system uses `Field()` to add descriptions,
defaults, and constraints to tool parameters. These annotations are converted
to JSON Schema for LLM consumption.

### JSON Schema Generation

The {doc}`schema builder <schema>` converts Python type annotations into JSON
Schema objects sent to LLM providers in tool definitions.

### Context store

The {doc}`context store <context>` manages conversation history. It is an
abstract base class with two required methods: `append(message)` and
`get_history()`. Built-in options:

- `MemoryContextStore` - in-memory, lives for the duration of a session.
- `SQLiteContextStore` (`axio-context-sqlite`) - persistent across process
  restarts, supports multiple named sessions.

Implement your own to back conversations with Redis, a relational database,
or any other storage layer.
