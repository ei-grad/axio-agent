# Writing Transports

A transport connects Axio to an LLM provider. Implement the
`CompletionTransport` protocol to add support for any API.

## The protocol

<!-- name: test_completion_transport_protocol -->
```python
from typing import runtime_checkable, Protocol
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from axio.messages import Message
from axio import Tool, StreamEvent


@runtime_checkable
class CompletionTransport(Protocol):
    def stream(
        self,
        messages: list[Message],
        tools: list[Tool],
        system: str,
    ) -> AsyncIterator[StreamEvent]: ...
```

Your transport must yield `StreamEvent` values as they arrive from the LLM.
The agent expects the stream to end with an `IterationEnd` event.

## Minimal implementation

<!-- name: test_echo_transport -->
```python
import asyncio
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from axio import CompletionTransport, Tool, TextDelta, IterationEnd, StreamEvent, StopReason, Usage
from axio.messages import Message
from axio.blocks import TextBlock


class EchoTransport:
    """Transport that echoes the last user message (for testing)."""

    async def stream(
        self,
        messages: list[Message],
        tools: list[Tool],
        system: str,
    ) -> AsyncIterator[StreamEvent]:
        # Find the last user message text
        last_text = ""
        for msg in reversed(messages):
            if msg.role == "user":
                for block in msg.content:
                    if hasattr(block, "text"):
                        last_text = block.text
                        break
                break

        # Yield it back as a text delta
        yield TextDelta(index=0, delta=f"Echo: {last_text}")

        # Always end with IterationEnd
        yield IterationEnd(
            iteration=1,
            stop_reason=StopReason.end_turn,
            usage=Usage(input_tokens=0, output_tokens=0),
        )


async def main():
    transport = EchoTransport()
    msgs = [Message(role="user", content=[TextBlock(text="ping")])]
    events = [e async for e in transport.stream(msgs, [], "")]
    assert isinstance(events[0], TextDelta)
    assert events[0].delta == "Echo: ping"
    assert isinstance(events[1], IterationEnd)
    assert events[1].stop_reason == StopReason.end_turn

asyncio.run(main())
```

In the example above `stream` is declared as an `async def` with `yield`
statements, making it an async generator. Production transports (e.g.
`AnthropicTransport`, `OpenAITransport`) instead declare `stream` as a plain
`def` that returns a call to a separate `async def _do_stream(...)` generator.
Both approaches satisfy the `CompletionTransport` protocol because both return
an `AsyncIterator[StreamEvent]`.

## Event contract

Your transport should yield these events in order:

1. **Content events** - any mix of:
   - `TextDelta` for text chunks
   - `ReasoningDelta` for reasoning/thinking chunks
   - `ToolUseStart` followed by `ToolInputDelta` for tool calls

2. **`IterationEnd`** - exactly once at the end, with:
   - `iteration`: the agent passes this, but transports can use `1`
   - `stop_reason`: `end_turn`, `tool_use`, `max_tokens`, or `error`
   - `usage`: token counts for this call

### Provider-reported cost

If a provider includes the operation's monetary cost in a known USD field, put
the validated value in `Usage.cost_usd` and set
`cost_source=CostSource.provider`. Reject booleans, strings, negative values,
NaN, and infinities rather than treating them as money. Leave both fields as
`None` when the response does not contain a trustworthy monetary value; a host
can then present a clearly labelled estimate from its model registry.

Provider contracts differ. OpenRouter documents
[automatic terminal usage with `usage.cost`](https://openrouter.ai/docs/cookbook/administration/usage-accounting),
marks `usage: {"include": true}` and
`stream_options: {"include_usage": true}` as deprecated no-ops, and says its
[API prices are denominated in US dollars](https://openrouter.ai/docs/faq).
By contrast, the documented Chat Completions usage schemas for
[OpenAI](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/chat) and
[Nebius](https://docs.tokenfactory.nebius.com/api-reference/inference/create-chat-completion)
list token counts but no monetary total. Treat the configured transport and its
documented response contract as the authority; do not infer cost currency from
a model name.

Do not add a local token-price estimate to a provider-reported total. Usage
chunks generally contain totals for the operation, so repeated chunks replace
the previous reported total rather than being summed. An interrupted stream
that never receives terminal usage must not invent a cost.

```python
from axio import CostSource, Usage

usage = Usage(
    input_tokens=100,
    output_tokens=20,
    cost_usd=0.0012,
    cost_source=CostSource.provider,
)
```

### Tool calls

When the LLM wants to call a tool, yield:

<!-- name: test_tool_call_events -->
```python
import asyncio
from axio import ToolUseStart, ToolInputDelta, IterationEnd, StopReason, Usage


async def example_tool_call_stream():
    usage = Usage(input_tokens=10, output_tokens=5)
    yield ToolUseStart(index=0, tool_use_id="call_abc", name="my_tool")
    yield ToolInputDelta(index=0, tool_use_id="call_abc", partial_json='{"arg": "value"}')
    yield IterationEnd(iteration=1, stop_reason=StopReason.tool_use, usage=usage)


async def main():
    events = [e async for e in example_tool_call_stream()]
    assert len(events) == 3

asyncio.run(main())
```

The agent assembles `ToolInputDelta` fragments into complete JSON. You can
yield multiple `ToolInputDelta` events for the same tool call if the API
streams the JSON incrementally.

### Multiple tool calls

For parallel tool calls, use different `index` values:

<!-- name: test_multiple_tool_calls -->
```python
import asyncio
from axio import ToolUseStart, ToolInputDelta, IterationEnd, StopReason, Usage


async def example_parallel_stream():
    usage = Usage(input_tokens=10, output_tokens=5)
    yield ToolUseStart(index=0, tool_use_id="call_1", name="tool_a")
    yield ToolUseStart(index=1, tool_use_id="call_2", name="tool_b")
    yield ToolInputDelta(index=0, tool_use_id="call_1", partial_json='{"x": 1}')
    yield ToolInputDelta(index=1, tool_use_id="call_2", partial_json='{"y": 2}')
    yield IterationEnd(iteration=1, stop_reason=StopReason.tool_use, usage=usage)


async def main():
    events = [e async for e in example_parallel_stream()]
    assert len(events) == 5

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Application integration

The core contract is only `CompletionTransport.stream()`. Resource ownership,
provider selection, configuration persistence, and model discovery belong to
the harness that constructs the transport.

## Tips

- Stream tokens as they arrive - don't buffer the full response.
- Track token usage accurately for cost monitoring.
- Handle API errors gracefully: yield `IterationEnd` with
  `stop_reason=StopReason.error` rather than letting exceptions propagate.
- For retryable errors (HTTP 429, 5xx), implement exponential backoff with
  respect to the `Retry-After` response header when present.
- Look at `axio-transport-openai` and `axio-transport-anthropic` for
  production-grade reference implementations using `aiohttp` and SSE parsing.
