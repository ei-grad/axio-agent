# Troubleshooting

Solutions for common issues when working with Axio.

## Installation

### `uv: command not found`

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) first:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or install Axio with pip: `pip install axio`.

## API Keys

### `StreamError: ... 401` on the first turn

No transport checks for a missing key. Each one defaults `api_key` to the environment
variable below, or to the empty string. An empty key reaches the provider and comes back
as a 401. The transport wraps that 401 in `axio.exceptions.StreamError`. Set the variable
for the transport you constructed:

```bash
# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Google (Gemini developer API; the realtime transport also accepts GOOGLE_API_KEY)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."

# Nebius
export NEBIUS_API_KEY="..."

# OpenRouter
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
```

`axio-transport-codex` uses OAuth rather than a key. Vertex AI uses Google Application
Default Credentials.


### `Invalid API key` / `Authentication error`

- Verify the key is correct - no extra spaces or quotes in the env var
- Check the key has not expired
- For OpenAI: make sure you have active billing
- For Anthropic: ensure the key has the right permissions

## Transport Connection

### `Connection refused` / `Failed to connect`

- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API endpoint is correct (especially for custom endpoints)
- Some corporate networks block external APIs - try using a VPN
- For OpenAI-compatible APIs: verify the base URL in your transport config

### `Timeout error`

- The API may be slow or experiencing high load
- Try again in a few moments
- If persistent, increase the timeout in your transport settings

### `SSL certificate error`

- Update your Python version - newer versions have updated CA certificates
- On macOS: run `/Applications/Python\ 3.x/Install\ Certificates.command`
- On Linux: update ca-certificates: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install ca-certificates`

## Provider Requests

(tools-and-reasoning-400)=
### 400: function tools and `reasoning_effort` cannot be combined

`/v1/chat/completions` refuses function tools beside any reasoning effort other than
`"none"`. A reasoning model reasons by default. A request that carries tools therefore
fails with a 400 naming a parameter you never sent.

`OpenAITransport.build_chat_payload` heads that off. When the model has
`Capability.reasoning` and the request carries tools, it sets `reasoning_effort: "none"`
and warns. The second symptom is therefore the warning rather than the 400. You then pay
for a reasoning model that is asked not to reason.

This affects the transports that speak that endpoint. `OpenAICompatibleTransport`,
`NebiusTransport` and `OpenRouterTransport` all set `api="chat"`. `OpenAITransport`
defaults to `api="responses"`. `/v1/responses` takes both together.

- On OpenAI itself, leave `api` at its default.
- On a compatible server that implements `/v1/responses`, pass `api="responses"`.
- On one that does not, decide the trade explicitly. Either pass
  `extra_params={"reasoning_effort": "low"}` - which suppresses the override - and drop
  the tools, or keep the tools and accept `"none"`.

### 400 from Anthropic on a replayed thinking block

With extended thinking on, a turn that thought and then called a tool is refused unless
its thinking comes back with the signature the API issued for it. The transport replays a
`ReasoningBlock` only when `signature` is set, or when `redacted` is. An unsigned block
is dropped rather than sent, because there is nothing to prove it is the model's.

The failure lands one turn late. The request that fails is the one *after* the turn whose
signature was lost. Suspect a context store that round-trips blocks through
`to_dict`/`from_dict` and drops the field. Never inspect, decode, re-encode or truncate a
signature. It is opaque, and a changed one is as bad as a missing one.

### `MISSING_THOUGHT_SIGNATURE` from Gemini

This is the same failure on Google's side. Google publishes it as a
`finishReason`. The transport maps it to `StopReason.error`, which ends the run.

Three replay paths, easy to confuse:

- A thought that had text goes back as a part with `thought: true` and its
  `thoughtSignature`.
- A signature that arrived on a *function-call* part goes back on that part, not on a
  thought part. Gemini puts the proof on the part it signed. Sent as a text-less thought
  part, the call it belongs to comes back `MISSING_THOUGHT_SIGNATURE`.
- A signature that arrived on a plain *answer-text* part is stored on that `TextBlock` and
  goes back on the text part. Held as reasoning it made a text-less thought part, whose
  proof the next unsigned call then took.

Parallel calls consume unplaced signatures in arrival order, so the store has to preserve
the order of blocks within the assistant turn.

### A turn that reads as an empty answer

`run()` returning `""` with no exception, on a prompt the model declined. The decline
arrives as a `Refusal` event, not as `TextDelta`. A renderer or a `get_final_text()` that
only collects text prints nothing.

`AgentStream.get_final_text()` - and so `Agent.run()` - collects `Refusal.text`, and
every transport now sends some. Gemini generates none of its own for a decline, so its
transport writes the text and marks it `spoken=False`: a blocked prompt carries
`blocked_input=True`, and a candidate that finished on `SAFETY`, `RECITATION` or the rest
carries the finish reason as its `category`.

The stop reason is still the thing to branch on. The text is for a reader. A refusal is terminal and deliberately not
an error. Reported as one, it leaves a caller unable to tell a decline from a broken
connection. The caller then retries something that can never work.

<!-- name: test_troubleshooting_declined_turn -->
```python
import asyncio

from axio import Agent, MemoryContextStore, Refusal, StopReason, Usage
from axio.events import IterationEnd, SessionEndEvent
from axio.testing import StubTransport

transport = StubTransport([[
    Refusal(index=0, category="safety", blocked_input=True),
    IterationEnd(0, StopReason.refusal, Usage(10, 0)),
]])
agent = Agent(system="You are helpful.", transport=transport)


async def diagnose() -> tuple[str, StopReason]:
    text: list[str] = []
    stop = StopReason.error
    stream = agent.run_stream("...", MemoryContextStore())
    async for event in stream:
        match event:
            case Refusal(text=refused):
                text.append(refused)
            case SessionEndEvent(stop_reason=stop_reason):
                stop = stop_reason
    return "".join(text), stop


answer, stop = asyncio.run(diagnose())
assert answer == ""
assert stop is StopReason.refusal
```

### A long turn that stops mid-answer

A reasoning event large enough to blow past `aiohttp`'s 131072-byte line limit. Reading
the stream by lines raises `LineTooLong`. `LineTooLong` is not a `ClientError`, so it
escapes the retry paths. The turn ends with no answer.

`axio-sse` exists for this. It takes chunks cut anywhere and never lines, so no line
length is a limit. Every transport in this repository reads through it, from
`resp.content.iter_any()`. A transport of your own that reads the response line by line
has the bug. Feed `axio_sse.payloads()` or `Reader.over()` the chunks instead.

The mirror-image mistake is a chunk iterator that strips line terminators - `httpx`'s
`aiter_lines()`, for one. The decoder needs them to know an event ended. Nothing
therefore dispatches at all, and the turn is silent rather than truncated.

## Tools

### `Tool not found`

Tools must be passed explicitly to the Agent:

```python
from my_tool import my_tool

agent = Agent(
    system="You are helpful.",
    tools=[my_tool],  # explicitly pass
    transport=transport,
)
```

### `Tool execution failed`

Check the error message:

- **Timeout**: the tool took too long - consider async optimization
- **Permission denied**: a guard blocked the tool - see "Permission guards" below
- **Import error**: check the tool handler's dependencies are installed

### `Tool returned empty result`

- Verify the tool logic is correct
- Check logs for exceptions during execution
- Add debug output in your tool handler to see what's happening

## Permission Guards

### `Permission denied` for every tool call

Guards are blocking all tool calls. Check:

1. Check which guards are attached to your agent in your configuration
2. For `PathGuard`: it asks before a tool touches a path. A yes allows the parent
   directory, and a no remembers the path. One denial therefore keeps denying for the
   rest of the session. Its default prompt calls `input()`. Pass a `prompt_fn` where
   there is no terminal to read from, or every call blocks
3. For `LLMGuard`: it puts the decision to an agent, so that agent's transport needs a
   working API key of its own

Both ship in `axio-tui-guards`, and are registered under the `axio.guards` entry-point
group. See {doc}`packages`.

## Context & Storage

### `Database is locked` (SQLite)

Multiple processes are accessing the same SQLite database. Solutions:

- Use WAL mode (enabled by default in Axio)
- Ensure you're using a single process
- Increase busy timeout in connection string

### `Session not found`

- Check the `session_id` is correct
- For SQLite: verify the database file exists and has data
- The session may have been deleted or expired

## Development

### `Module not found` when importing axio

Ensure you're in the right environment:

```bash
uv run --directory axio python -c "import axio; print(axio.__file__)"
```

`uv run --directory <package>` is how every command in this workspace is run. There is no
`uv shell`. To get an interactive environment instead, create one with `uv venv` and
activate it.

### Type checking errors

Axio uses strict typing. Every package sets `strict = true`. Each is checked from its own
directory. `mypy axio/` from the repository root points at the distribution directory
rather than at the sources under `axio/src/axio`:

```bash
make typing                      # every package
uv run --directory axio mypy .   # one package
```

### Tests failing

Run tests with verbose output:

```bash
uv run --directory axio pytest -v
```

Every package sets `testpaths = ["tests", "README.md"]`, so its README's Python blocks are
executed too. The documentation has its own suite: `make test-docs`.

Check if the failure is in your code or the framework:

- If in framework: open an issue on GitHub
- If in your code: verify against the test examples in `docs/` and `axio/tests/`
