Axio is a small asynchronous foundation for building LLM agent harnesses in
Python. It provides the agent loop and explicit extension points for model
transports, tools, context storage, permissions, and streamed events.

Axio is a library, not an application framework. Your code keeps control of
sessions, input and output, resource lifetimes, persistence, observability, and
deployment.

## The boundary Axio provides

    H[Your harness] -->|prompt + context| A[Agent loop]
    A -->|one request| T[Transport]

    A -->|validated call| X[Async tools]
    A <--> C[Context store]
    A -->|typed events| H
~~~

The transport normalizes one provider request into typed events. The agent
consumes those events, executes requested tools, appends results to context,
and calls the transport again. Your harness consumes the same event stream and
turns it into application behavior.

Start with {doc}`quick-start`. One small harness grows through four causal
stages:

1. give a text-only agent useful tools and enforce their boundaries;
2. make every action visible, persistent, and bounded in context;
3. isolate generated code and separate concurrent user sessions;
4. add runtime integrations, a product event protocol, and deterministic tests.

## Design principles

Explicit composition
: Create an Agent from a transport and tools, then supply one context store per
  session. Dependencies remain visible in ordinary Python.

Provider isolation
: Provider-specific authentication, message encoding, streaming, and stop
  reasons stay behind CompletionTransport.

Typed streaming
: Text, reasoning, refusals, citations, tool requests, tool results, usage, and
  failures are observable while the turn runs. A payload axio has no type for is
  forwarded rather than dropped, so nothing a provider sends disappears on the way
  through.

Application-owned state
: Context is supplied by the caller. The same agent definition can serve many
  isolated sessions.

Plain async tools
: Tool handlers are async functions. Annotations become the input schema.
  Guards, runtime context, and concurrency limits are explicit.
